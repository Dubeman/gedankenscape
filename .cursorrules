Music Iteration Tool

## Vibe
Minimal, dark, haunted. Like Radiohead b-sides. Tool disappears, music emerges.

## Tech
- React functional components
- Mock AI responses until UI feels right
- WaveSurfer.js for audio

## Priorities
1. Feel over correctness
2. Working over perfect
3. Fast iteration over clean code

## Style
- Dark backgrounds (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a range)
- Subtle interactions (no flashy animations)
- Large, touchable waveforms
- Spacebar = play/pause always

## Don't
- Add TypeScript unless I ask
- Refactor working code unprompted
- Use component libraries (build minimal custom)
