Experimental music iteration tool with AI assistance.

## Philosophy

Bridging the gap between AI's raw power and the workflows artists actually use. Current AI music tools expose model parameters (temperature, prompts) that feel alien to musicians familiar with Ableton, Pro Tools, or other production tools.



Inspired by [Beyond Skeuomorphism](https://www.arpjournal.com/asarpwp/beyond-skeuomorphism-the-evolution-of-music-production-software-user-interface-metaphors-2/) — exploring what music tools look like when designed for the AI era, not retrofitted onto analog metaphors.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```


## Tech

React, Vite, WaveSurfer.js, Web Audio API
