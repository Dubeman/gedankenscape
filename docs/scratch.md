# Current Session

## Focus
Getting basic audio playback working

## Ideas
- Waveform should be big, inviting
- Click-to-seek must feel instant
- Maybe add keyboard shortcuts early?

## Questions
- Which waveform library feels best?
- How to handle large audio files?

## Next
Start with drag-drop audio → waveform render
```
