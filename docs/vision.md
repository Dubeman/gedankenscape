# Vision

## The Feeling
Like discovering Radiohead demos in a dark room.
Haunting. Minimal. Immediate. No friction between impulse and sound.

## Core Experience
1. Load your guitar riff
2. Type "darker, more space"  
3. Hear result in seconds
4. Branch infinitely
5. Full creative genealogy preserved

## Success
Making music, not configuring software.

## Inspiration
- Street Spirit (Fade Out) - atmosphere
- Kid A era - experimental
- Ableton's workflow - but simpler
